##### DONE ##### -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...


##### NOW ##### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
finish logic to create instructions from procedures and operators
    dont forget to optimize instructions
    add check for interface compatibility in procedure
    validate operator input and output count on its procedure type creation

add test for expression instruction creation service
add test for command instruction creation service
add test for procedure instruction creation service
add test for instruction optimization service


##### SOON ##### -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add test for exception handling logic (if needed)
add tests for simple procedure examples execution
extend tests for procedure type service


##### LATER ##### -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wrap all expression services with try catch and rethrow if needed

add storage for statical entities
    I think I will use sqlite
    the question is if we want some version control system or not ...
        we might do something like export to DML
            where we would export each component in a specific file and folder
            blobs would be excluded though
            also, free form strings might be tricky in this case
                do we want to limit what can be written to a text object?

add ui (choose the most suitable toolkit)


##### MAYBE LATER ##### ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add scheduler(s)
add optimization for local (anonymous expression) variable count
    tip: idea for expression variable count
        I think we need at most the number of variables as it is max number of expression parameters
            the only problem with this would be the current implementation of assignment

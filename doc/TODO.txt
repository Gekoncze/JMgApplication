##### DONE ##### -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
finished member instruction creation services


##### NOW ##### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dont forget to connect expression instructions at the end of its resolution
add interface call command and instruction

finish logic to create instructions from commands
finish logic to create instructions from expressions


##### SOON ##### -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add definition-variable validation for all commands and expressions
    need to make sure wrong variable is not used

extend tests for procedure type and class type

add test for exception handling service
add test for instruction creation service
add test for instruction optimization service
add test for instruction validation service
add test for instruction collector service
add test for expression instruction creation service

add tests for simple procedure examples execution


##### LATER ##### -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add storage for statical entities
    I think I will use sqlite
    the question is if we want some version control system or not ...
        we might do something like export to DML
            where we would export each component in a specific file and folder
            blobs would be excluded though
            also, free form strings might be tricky in this case
                do we want to limit what can be written to a text object?

add ui (choose the most suitable toolkit)


##### MAYBE LATER ##### ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add optimization for local (anonymous expression) variable count
add optimization for begin/end mark instruction removal
add scheduler(s)
tip: idea for expression variable count
    I think we need at most the number of variables as it is max number of expression parameters
        the only problem with this would be the current implementation of assignment
        investigate ...

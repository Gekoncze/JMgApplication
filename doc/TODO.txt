##### DONE ##### -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...


##### NOW ##### --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add storage for entities
    I think I will use sqlite
    think of the best strategy
    I could use @part @link @shared annotations
    and maybe add some interface or annotation to check if it is saveable

add export to DML for version control
    export location as folder
    export components into a file
    resources will be just copied to a folder
    also, free form strings might be tricky in this case
        do we want to limit what can be written to a text object?


##### SOON ##### -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add test for expression instruction creation service
add test for command instruction creation service
add test for instruction optimization service
add test for rollback


##### LATER ##### -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add ui (choose the most suitable toolkit)
    decide if I want to have it auto-generated or manually-generated


##### MAYBE LATER ##### ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add scheduler(s) for cores or threads ?

add optimization for local (anonymous expression) variable count
    each expression does not have to create new variable, they could reuse existing variables
    in our case it does not matter, it would matter though if exported to another language
    tip: idea for expression variable count
        I think we need at most the number of variables as it is max number of expression parameters
            the only problem with this would be the current implementation of assignment
